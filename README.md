# Cardiomegaly Detection In Chest X-Rays Using Machine Learning

This project is designed to give patients a "second opinion" of their chest X-ray. This is accomplished by training a Convolutional Naural Network Sequential model on 112K labled images of chest X-rays and hosting the model on the internet for free and open access.
